        title:
            body: |
                This is the title of the brick (piece of code/guide/recipe) you are creating.
                <br><br>
                A good <b>Title</b> should be:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>full of keywords</b>: try putting in the title all the keywords related to the subject of your guide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>comprehensive</b>: the title should be as short and simple as possible; this field will be displayed in the whole symfonybricks.com as well as in the result pages of the search engines
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <i>Example</i>: if the brick you are going to create is about <i>"embedding the Bootstrap css rules for forms in a Symfony2 project, using smart macros. And I'd like them to be flexible and adaptable"</i>, surely using it as title is not good thing.
                <br><br>
                Since keywords are: "bootstrap, embed, form, macro, twig, integrate/integration", better titles could be:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>"Integrate Bootstrap base css Form styles in twig templates"</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>"Use of macros to integrate Bootstrap base css Form styles in twig templates"</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            title: "Brick: Title"

        description:
            body: |
                You can provide a brief additional description, about the subject you are going to treat: this field lets you explain better what is the problem you are facing, and what is the proposed solution.
                <br><br>
                As well as the Title, also this field contains sensible informations for the search engines.
                <br><br>
                As a guideline, you can consider to explain these points:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>what is the problem you are facing, or the functionality you want to add</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>how did you solve the problem and the solution you adopted; eg: what bundles have been installad, external libraries installed and configured, etc...</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            title: "Brick: Description"

        canonical_url:
            body: |
                You can specify a canonical url for a brick. Using Google's definition, <b>a canonical page is the preferred version of a set of pages with highly similar content.</b>
                <br><br>
                This field is useful for example when you publish a guide on your blog, and then publish the same content on SymfonyBricks too. The <b>Canonical url</b> lets Google not to punish your blog post in search results because of the repetition of the content in SymfonyBricks.
                <br><br>
                Put in this field the url of the original article/blog post/webpage, so google will give priority to it instead of the content published on SymfonyBricks.
                <br><br><br>

        tags:
            body: |
                Tags are labels of text you can attach to a brick; a tag can be composed by one or more words.
                <br><br>
                A good tag should observe the following rules:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>be short:</b> most of the times a tag is a single word, like <b>configuration</b>, <b>doctrine</b>, <b>databse</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>singular:</b> if possible, try to use a <i>singular nouns</i>; for example use <b>databse</b> instead of <b>databases</b>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
